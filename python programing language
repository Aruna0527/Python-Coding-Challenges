python programing
      Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. It is not a category of coding languages, but rather a single, distinct language known for its readability and versatility.
Key characteristics of Python:
    Interpreted: Python code is executed line by line by an interpreter, rather than being compiled into machine code before execution. This allows for rapid prototyping and testing.
    High-level: Python abstracts away many low-level details of computer hardware, making it easier for developers to write and understand code.
    General-purpose: Python can be used for a wide variety of applications, including web development (server-side), data science and machine learning, software development, automation and scripting, and more.
    Dynamically typed: Variables in Python do not require explicit type declarations; their type is determined at runtime based on the value assigned to them.
    Object-oriented: Python supports object-oriented programming paradigms, allowing for the creation of reusable code through classes and objects.
    Extensive libraries: Python boasts a vast collection of libraries and frameworks that extend its functionality and simplify development for various tasks.
 Overview
Each challenge focuses on key Python concepts such as:

        Variables, Data Types, and Operators
        Conditional Statements and Loops
        Functions and Modules
        Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries
        String Manipulation
        File Handling
        Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
