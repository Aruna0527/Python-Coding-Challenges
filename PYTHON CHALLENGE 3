    Tuple, Immutable vs Mutable, List Creation
Project Title: Retail Inventory Manager
Scenario:
    You are managing an inventory system for a retail shop. Certain product categories are fixed, but the actual products can be added or removed by the staff.
Tasks:
  Create a tuple with fixed product categories like Electronics, Stationery, and Clothing.
  Create a list of products that can be updated dynamically.
  Ask the user to enter a new product and add it to the list.
  Ask the user to input the index of a product to remove it from the list.
  Display the final list of products and the product categories.
Step 1: Create Tuple for each student (immutable personal info)
  Student1 = ("Ram", 1, "M.A")
  Student2 = ("Kumar", 2, "B.A")
  Student3 = ("Darlo", 3, "B.E")

Step 2: Create 1D List for marks of each student
  marks1 = [100,  40, 60]
  marks2 = [80, 100, 90]
  marks3= [95, 78, 75]
Step 3: Combine all marks into a 2D List
Step 4: Combine all batches (3D List - two different batches)
    batch 1 = [marks1, marks2,marks3]
    All batches= [batch 1,batch2]
Step 5: Display formatted data

print("Marks1",marks1)
print("Marks2",marks2)
print("Marks3",marks3)

print("------2d------")
print("2d list",Batch1)

print("-------3d--------")
print("3d list", all batches )
